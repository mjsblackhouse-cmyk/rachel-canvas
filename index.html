                <h2>🎯 Current Situation & Context</h2>
                <div class="insight-box">
                    "If you'd asked me two years ago, I probably would have said I would stay at EY... I don't think that's true anymore... I'd want to do something completely different."
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Professional:</strong> Director at EY for 10.5 years, started as Perth grad. Recently promoted but team restructure removed valued colleagues and leadership. Partnership track available but not compelling.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Personal:</strong> Married to Josh, recently bought house in Melbourne. Primary breadwinner. Working on family planning ("still working on the baby thing"). Josh's role currently Melbourne-centric.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Geographic:</strong> Not wedded to Melbourne long-term. Strong friendship network in Sydney. Perth possible longer-term ("don't tell mum!").</p>

                <div class="insight-box critical">
                    <strong>Recent NAB Situation:</strong> Five-interview process for transformation delivery role. Right on paper (business-tech bridge, right level, Melbourne-based, referral) but Rachel decided to withdraw before role went on hold. Key insight: "I wasn't excited about it... not excited enough to tide me over the poor behaviour." Reveals need for BOTH role alignment AND organisational culture standards.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="canvas-section">
                <h2>💎 Core Values (Tier 1: Non-Negotiables)</h2>
                
                <div class="value-item">
                    <strong>Respect & Dignity in Workplace</strong><br>
                    "There's a baseline level of respect for how you should speak to people... when people breach that... I find that outrageous." Strongest emotional response - this is dealbreaker territory.
                </div>

                <div class="value-item">
                    <strong>Collaborative Relationships</strong><br>
                    Scored 80/20 collaboration vs. autonomy. When asked team vs. organisation: "Probably the team" (no hesitation). Team quality matters more than organisational prestige.
                </div>

                <div class="value-item">
                    <strong>Tangible Impact</strong><br>
                    Must see practical outcomes. Prefers embedded delivery over external advisory. "I don't like advising my clients and get a lot of joy out of that."
                </div>

                <div class="value-item">
                    <strong>Ethical Integrity</strong><br>
                    Righteous indignation about unethical behaviour, expressed diplomatically. Works behind scenes for change rather than public confrontation.
                </div>

                <div class="quote">
                    "When I see someone on the phone in the office and the way they're talking to someone... it shocks me."

                <div class="insight-box">
                    Rachel's former boss (moved in restructure) represents leadership she both admires and requires:
                </div>

                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">
                    <li>"Really genuinely cares about people"</li>
                    <li>Remembers colleague's mother's illness years later, continues checking in</li>
                    <li>Remembers personal details: "If we're going for dinner, he's like, you don't eat pork"</li>
                    <li>"Very easy to be like, I'm so busy... client comes first... but he genuinely cares about team"</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Significance:</strong> This relationship loss from restructure was more impactful than initially recognised. Sets standard for leadership environment she requires.</p>

                <div class="quote">
                    "He really remembers the things that people outside of the work context... I just find that really impressive."

                <div class="strength-item">
                    <strong>Leading & Organising</strong><br>
                    Natural leader who creates structure and organises people toward outcomes. "I'm the one who suggests the Adelaide trip, provides venue options, confirms attendees."
                </div>

                <div class="strength-item">
                    <strong>Collaborating & Embedding</strong><br>
                    Being "in it" with teams. Mentoring others. Collaborative problem-solving. Suncorp demerger stood out because she was embedded, not external advisory.
                </div>

                <div class="strength-item">
                    <strong>Stakeholder Influence (When Respectful)</strong><br>
                    Good with people, enjoys stakeholder relationships. Can have challenging conversations about different perspectives. But becomes draining when people are "rude or unreasonable" or "not helping solve problem together."

                    <strong>Business Development</strong><br>
                    Particularly "selling what we'll figure out." Good at building relationships but struggles with confidence to say "we'll help you" without delivery certainty. This is values misalignment, not imposter syndrome.
                </div>

                <div class="drain-item">
                    <strong>Deep Analytical Work</strong><br>
                    Numbers, data analysis, report writing. Can do it but effortful rather than energising. Prefers practical application over theoretical analysis.
                </div>

                <div class="drain-item">
                    <strong>Organisational Politics</strong><br>
                    Will navigate when necessary but excessive politics with poor-faith actors is offensive and draining. "A lot of partners are just connector of people... I don't know if they're doing a good job."
                </div>

                <div class="quote">

                <div class="discovery-item">
                    <strong>Not a Consultant at Heart</strong><br>
                    "The consulting piece, I don't feel that strongly wedded to... it's more the getting the thing done, driving the outcome." Rachel is a delivery leader who happens to work in consulting, not someone fulfilled by advisory model.

                <div class="discovery-item">
                    <strong>Partnership Track Definitively Ruled Out</strong><br>
                    "Not that interesting to me right now... maybe it's less important to me at the moment as a skill to build." Partnership requires capabilities she doesn't value (individual sales vs. collaborative delivery) and finds ethically uncomfortable (promising uncertain outcomes).
                </div>

                <div class="discovery-item">
                    <strong>Financial Services as Default, Not Passion</strong><br>
                    Likes FS because it's "relatable" and "everyone gets it" - comprehensibility matters more than passion. Open to adjacent sectors if they meet criteria.
                </div>

                <div class="discovery-item">
                    <strong>Two-Year Evolution</strong><br>
                    Two years ago would have stayed at EY with financial freedom. Now wouldn't. Shift catalysed by: restructure + family planning + observation of partner struggles + disillusionment with consulting model.

                <div class="aspirational-box">
                    <h3>Path A: Entrepreneurship (With Partner)</h3>
                    <p>"Love planning events and creating things people enjoy... find someone with idea... they've got creative side, I've got execution capability... team up and build something from scratch."</p>
                    <p><strong>Not solo entrepreneur</strong> - requires collaborative partner. Examples: event planning, experience creation, building something tangible people value.</p>

                <div class="aspirational-box">
                    <h3>Path B: Meaningful Impact</h3>
                    <p>"Working for charity organisation... take consulting skill sets and help them... more fulfilling than helping big banks save money."</p>
                    <p><strong>Preference:</strong> Cancer Council or medical/health causes with "real people impact." Would prefer "at the coal face working with people" over corporate charity bureaucracy. Even considered overseas volunteering for tangible impact.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="insight-box">
                    <strong>Common Themes:</strong> Creating tangible outcomes people value | Collaborative partnership | Human impact over commercial optimisation | Using existing capabilities in new context | Visible, felt experience of making difference

                <div class="tension-item">
                    <strong>Justice vs. Generosity</strong><br>
                    Wants to be generous (giving more than required) but deeply values fairness. Struggle: "Both things can be true... didn't seem like inverse." May struggle when constraints prevent being generous while maintaining equity.
                </div>

                <div class="tension-item">
                    <strong>Industriousness vs. Contentment</strong><br>
                    Achievement drive without accompanying satisfaction. "I don't sit on contentment for very long... what's the next thing?" Risk of burnout from continuous striving without acknowledging success.
                </div>

                <div class="tension-item">
                    <strong>Ambition vs. Moderation</strong><br>
                    "I'm not big goal setter... more do the best with what's in front of me." Reactive to opportunities rather than proactive career planning. Needs help translating achievement drive into strategic direction.
                </div>

                <div class="tension-item">
                    <strong>Self-Criticism vs. Self-Compassion</strong><br>
                    Learning to be kinder to herself but naturally self-critical. May struggle with visibility at senior levels if overly self-critical. Potential imposter syndrome at executive level.

                <h3 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 15px;">The "Both/And" Requirement</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The NAB situation revealed Rachel's decision-making pattern clearly:</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; color: #333;">She needs BOTH role alignment AND organisational behaviour/culture standards met.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">One without the other is insufficient. This explains why:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>NAB ticked practical boxes but process concerns made her withdraw</li>
                    <li>EY provided security/advancement but restructure removed valued elements</li>
                    <li>Partnership offers clear path but doesn't align with values/strengths</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic;">Her selection criteria are stringent. This will take time and discernment - but she'll know when she's found it.</p>

                <h3 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.3em;">Not: "Should I stay at EY or go to NAB?"</h3>
                
                <h3 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.3em;">But Rather:</h3>
                
                <p style="font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    "What career architecture serves the next decade of my life - honouring who I actually am, developing into the leader I want to become, accommodating the realities of dual-career partnership and family formation, and creating work that feels meaningful rather than just successful?"
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.7; opacity: 0.95;">
                    This is not about choosing between known options. It's about designing what kind of leader she wants to become and what kind of life she wants to build. That's why completing her decision framework matters - so she can evaluate any opportunity against what actually matters to her, rather than reacting to what presents itself.

                <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.7;">
                    "Am I willing to trade consulting trajectory and immediate certainty for industry depth and the possibility of becoming the kind of integrated leader I admire - someone who leads through genuine care for people, creates tangible impact, and can be fully herself rather than maintaining two separate sides?"

                    By end of Session 3, Rachel will feel: <em>"I know what matters most to me... I know how to evaluate any option that comes along... I trust my judgment to make a good decision... There's no perfect answer, just trade-offs I'm willing to make... I can do this myself."</em>
                </p>
