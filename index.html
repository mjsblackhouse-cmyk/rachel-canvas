                    <p><strong>Life Integration:</strong> Creating a professional trajectory that accommodates motherhood, aligns with personal values, and doesn't require sacrificing either family or career authenticity.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Authentic Leadership:</strong> Operating in roles where baseline professional respect is non-negotiable, and where servant leadership and genuine care for people are valued as much as business results.</p>

                    <div class="pathway-box">
                        <strong>Pathway A: EY Partnership Track</strong>
                        Requires business development capability and increasing exposure to high-stakes client relationships, political navigation, and organizational visibility. More prestige and security. Trade-off: Moving away from delivery impact and toward selling. Status: Not currently energizing.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="pathway-box">
                        <strong>Pathway B: Industry Transformation Role (MOST ALIGNED)</strong>
                        Head of / Executive Manager position in financial services or adjacent sector. Embedded in the transformation, leading the team delivering it. Tangible impact, collaborative environment, closer to the work. Trade-off: Slightly lower income, learning curve, some organizational politics. Status: Aligned with strengths and values.
                    </div>

                        <strong>Pathway C: Purpose-Driven Long-Term Vision</strong>
                        Own business (partnering with creative), charity/health sector leadership, or coalface work with direct community impact. Maximum meaning and alignment. Trade-off: Significant income reduction, requires platform-building first. Status: Aspirational 3-5 year possibility.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="critical-insight">
                        <strong>Critical Realization:</strong> Two years ago, staying at EY felt certain. Now, leaving feels possible and even necessary. This is not drift—it's significant readiness. The question is not IF to move, but WHEN and WHERE.

                    <p><strong>External Obstacles:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Timing: Maternity leave window limits availability for immediate transition</li>
                        <li>Market perception: "EY Director" brand both asset and potential signal of external focus</li>
                        <li>Sector gravity: Financial services transformation roles may require networking/visibility she hasn't built</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Internal Obstacles:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Imposter syndrome in new environment (embedded vs external advisor perspective)</li>
                        <li>Fear of choosing "wrongly" and disappointing expectations (family, Josh, self)</li>
                        <li>Tendency to over-prepare rather than step into uncertainty</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Identity Transition:</strong> Moving from "external expert" to "embedded leader" requires different confidence base. She has the capability; needs to own it differently.</p>
